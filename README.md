#READ ROADMAP.TXT !!!!!!!!
This repository contains an ASP.NET MVC web application for a game catalogue where users can add reviews to various games. The application provides a platform for gamers to explore and share their experiences with different games.

## Tech Stack

The application is built using the following technologies:

- C# programming language
- .NET framework
- Entity Framework Core for database operations
- SQL Server as the database management system
- HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for front-end development

## Goals

The primary goals of this project are as follows:

1. Implement Paging: Utilize EF Core to enable efficient paging of game reviews, allowing users to navigate through reviews using page numbers.

2. Image Covers for Games: Enhance the user experience by integrating image covers for games, providing visual representations of each game in the catalogue.

3. User Authentication with Identity: Implement user authentication using ASP.NET Identity, allowing users to create accounts, log in, and manage their reviews.

4. User Roles: Implement user roles (such as admin and regular user) to provide differentiated access and functionality based on user privileges.
